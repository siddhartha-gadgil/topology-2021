<h2>Online lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures are slide-shows consisting of videos (screencasts) mostly alternating with quizzes. You can make the videos
    full-screen.
    It is recommended that you watch with "quality" at least 720p to avoid fuzzy writing (click on the setting at the
    bottom of the YouTube video to specify this).</p>
