<h2>Online lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures are slide-shows consisting of videos (screencasts) mostly alternating with quizzes. You can make the videos
    full-screen.
    It is recommended that you watch with "quality" at least 720p to avoid fuzzy writing (click on the setting at the
    bottom of the YouTube video to specify this).</p>

    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture1.html" target="_blank">Lecture 1:</a> <strong>Introduction.</strong>
        <p>We begin with introductory remarks on topological properties and spaces. We then give a precise definition of 
            topological spaces and give the simplest examples.
